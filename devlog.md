### Thoughts
- Start by outlining the requirements and key features:
  - Menu-driven program to manage index files with B-Trees.
  - Commands include: `create`, `open`, `insert`, `search`, `load`, `print`, `extract`, `quit`.
  - Use 512-byte blocks and B-Tree structure with a minimal degree of 10.
### Plan
- Set up the basic file structure.
- Implement the `create` and `open` commands as they are foundational.
